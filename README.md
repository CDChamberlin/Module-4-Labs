A repository for Module 4 Labs

## Lab 1: Figma
    Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your content and posts from other users are visible. Don’t just jump into Figma, try to follow the design procedure.

## Lab 2: Cards
1. Exercise 1 : Modify the addCard function from the previous slide so that you can pass content for the card dynamically.
2. Exercise 2 : Call addCard repeatedly so that your cards are automatically generated based on data from an array. This way you will create as many cards as you need to display all the data in the array.
3. Exercise 3 - the artist’s portfolio: Populate the page dynamically, by generating an artist profile card which includes cards representing the items in an artist's portfolio. 
*Extension*: make an array of artists, all with multiple portfolio items.

## Lab 3: Calculator
    In this exercise you will need to create a calculator. 
Requirements:
1. The application should take 2 numbers, and  support 4 operations (+, / , x , -). 
2. You need to press the equals button to get 
the result displayed, and reset to clear it. 

*NOTE: Do not use the eval() function - it is a security risk and bypasses custom logic*
